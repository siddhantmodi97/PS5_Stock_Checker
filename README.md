# PS5 Stock Checker
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple Selenium bot to continuously check PS5 stock on various websites.

# Websites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Walmart
- BestBuy 
- Target

# Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You will need to set up the path for **Chrome Driver** for selenium. 
- The links used in the code includes my local store so they will need to be updated according to the users location. 
- There is no other setup needed.
- File named tpbb checks best buy and target together.

# Running 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as selenuim is set up the code just needs to be complied, some websites have added bot checkers so this code may not work in the future.

## Success
